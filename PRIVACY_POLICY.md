# Privacy Policy for Lotto Go

**Last updated: February 03, 2026**

This privacy policy applies to the **Lotto Go** app (herein referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by the developer. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Application is designed with a "Local First" philosophy to ensure maximum security.

*   **No Personal Data Uploads**: The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) to our servers or any third-party cloud services.
*   **Local Storage**: Any data you save within the app (such as "Saved Tickets" or "Favorite Numbers") is stored **entirely on your local device**. This data is never uploaded to the cloud and is absolutely secure under your control. Uninstalling the Application will remove this local data.

## 2. Permissions and Their Purpose
The Application requests specific permissions to provide its core features. We strictly limit their use as follows:

*   **Camera**: The Camera permission is used **solely for scanning QR codes** on official lottery tickets to help you check results quickly. The Application does not take photos, record videos, or store any visual data. It only processes the QR code string locally to match lottery results.
*   **Notifications**: The Application may send you push notifications. These are used **exclusively for lottery draw updates** and results alerts. We do not use notifications for advertising or any other purpose.
*   **Internet Access**: Required to fetch the latest official lottery results from our data sources and to display ads.

## 3. Third-Party Services
To provide a free service and improve user experience, the Application uses the following third-party services which may collect information used to identify you:

*   **Google Play Services**: Required for core Android functionality.
*   **AdMob**: Used to display advertisements. AdMob may use device identifiers to show personalized ads.
*   **Firebase Analytics**: Used to collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., which screens are visited most) to help us improve the Application. This data is aggregated and does not identify individual users.

## 4. Security
We value your trust in providing us your access to your device's features. We use industry-standard encryption for data transmitted (like fetching results) and ensure that no sensitive data is ever stored outside your device.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
